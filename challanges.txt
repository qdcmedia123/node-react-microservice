1. Sometimes really get error like image unable to create such as ImagePullOff or any other error simply stop the minikube and restart its started to work

In MacBook there was another issue I spent almost 4 hrs to figure out why its not working, I Mac qinikube you can not use 
The docker driver while starting qinikube. Therefore following things solve my issue, I was really worried believe me.

minikube config set vm-driver hyperkit
minikube delete
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress

Here we are configuring vm-dirver to hyper kit not the docker driver 

In this way ingress was able to work properly. Almost three hours really

In linux you don't have to do anything like this
